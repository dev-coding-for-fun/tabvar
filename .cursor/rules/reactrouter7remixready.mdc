This project has the Remix v3_singleFetch mode enabled.  This means that code should remove calls to json() and defer() in favour of raw objects.

Single Fetch supports JSON objects and Promises out of the box, so you can return the raw data from your loader/action functions.

This return statement is now deprecated: return json(tasks);
Instead, it can simply look like this: return tasks;

If you were using the second parameter of json/defer to set a custom status or headers on your response, you can continue doing so via the new data API (please note that you will need a headers export to apply those headers to Single Fetch data requests).

To do this, instead of importing 'json' from @remix-run/node, import 'data' instead, then:

Instead of:
return json(tasks, {
    headers: {
      "Cache-Control": "public, max-age=604800"
    }
});

It should now look like:
return data(tasks, {
    headers: {
      "Cache-Control": "public, max-age=604800"
    }

});
